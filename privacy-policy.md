Privacy Policy for NotebookLM Source Uploader
Last Updated: July 7, 2025
Thank you for using the NotebookLM Source Uploader Chrome Extension ("the Extension"). This policy is intended to help you understand what information the Extension does—and, more importantly, does not—collect.
Your privacy is extremely important to us. The Extension is designed to be a simple, secure, and purely functional tool.
1. No Data Collection
The NotebookLM Source Uploader operates entirely on your local computer, within your browser. We want to be perfectly clear:
We do not collect, store, log, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
We do not track your browsing activity or your usage of the extension.
The URLs you paste into the extension are never saved or sent to any server controlled by us or any third party. The data is processed locally and temporarily for the sole purpose of the extension's functionality.
The Extension is designed to be completely stateless. It has no database, no analytics, and no server component.
2. How Your Information is Used
The only data the Extension handles are the URLs you voluntarily provide in the text field. This information is used exclusively to perform the core function of the Extension:
The URLs are passed from the extension's popup interface to a script that runs locally on the Google NotebookLM tab within your own browser.
The script uses these URLs to automate the process of clicking buttons and filling in forms on the NotebookLM website.
This data exists only temporarily in your computer's memory during the automation process and is discarded immediately after. It is never stored on your hard drive or transmitted over the network by the Extension.
3. Permissions Justification
The Extension requires a few permissions to function, all of which are strictly limited to its stated purpose:
tabs: This permission is required to check if a Google NotebookLM tab is already open, to open a new tab if one is not found, and to make it the active tab.
scripting & host_permissions for notebooklm.google.com: These permissions are essential to allow the extension to run its automation script on the NotebookLM website. This script is what performs the clicks and data entry on your behalf. The extension cannot function without this permission.
4. Third-Party Services
The Extension is built to interact solely with the Google NotebookLM service (notebooklm.google.com). Your use of Google NotebookLM is subject to Google's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Our extension does not alter that relationship in any way.
5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the extension's functionality changes. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy.
6. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.
